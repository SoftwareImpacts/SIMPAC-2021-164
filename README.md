# LUS_Video_Summarization
An implementation of the summarization algorithm in the paper titled - Unsupervised multi-latent space reinforcement learning framework for video summarization in ultrasound imaging.

The code for generating the summary along with the models and a few example LUS scans are provided in the google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DRsY9yIu_sYroIXNN6ioYg1KqDXkKS3O?usp=sharing).

A high level outline of the proposed system methodology is given in the figure below. Please refer to the article for complete details.
